## Introduction
Traditional drug discovery relies on slow, expensive trial-and-error chemistry, limiting the scope of exploration and innovation. As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, the public increasingly expects the rapid development of effective treatments. Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform the speed and efficiency of drug discovery, as it has done for numerous scientific and engineering disciplines over the past decade. AlphaFold, PandaOmics, and Chemistry42 have helped identify a novel hit molecule against a novel target without an experimental structure, starting from target selection towards hit identification, in a cost-and-time efficient manner. 

### Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The focus of the applications of these AI tools will be on Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) due to its high prevalance in liver cancers and lack of effective treatments.HCC is the most common type of primary liver cancer account for about 75-85% of all liver cancers. This specific case study is the first reported example that successfully utilized AlphaFold-predicted protein structures to identify a confirmed hit for a novel target in early drug discovery. 

## Key Tools and Technologies

### AlphaFold

AlphaFold is an AI system developed by Google DeepMind that predicts a protein's 3D structure from its amino acid sequence with high accuracy. It provides critical insights into protein functions and binding sites, bypassing the need for experimental structural data and is a pivotal tool in accelerating the drug discovery process by enabling structure based design. AlphaFold has revolutionalized structural biology, by reducing time and resources needed to determine protein structures, which traditionally required labor intensive texhniques like X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy.

### PandaOmics

PandaOmics is an AI-driven platform developed by Insilico Medicine for therapeutic target and biomarker discovery. By integrating diverse datasets such as gene expression, proteomics, and transcriptomics with scientific literature, it identifies and ranks potential drug targets. It then filters these targets based on novelty, druggability, safety, and disease relevance, streamlining research focus.

### Chemistry42

Chemistry42 is a generative chemistry platform developed by Insilico Medicinethat designs and optimizes novel drug-like molecules. It uses machine learning to evaluate compound interactions with target proteins, prioritizing the best candidates for testing and synthesis. 
Some key features of Chemestry42 include: 
- Generative Chemistry - designs new small molecules optimized for specific targets, and facilitating de novo design
- ADMET Profiling - predicts and refines absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profiles of molecules
- Alchemistry - estimates relative binding free energies
- Golden Cubes - predicts kinome activity
